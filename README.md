## First things first ... why call it `FFS-TA`?

There's the story, and then there's the reality. As with most such things the story is better than the reality, so I'll start with that.

### The Story

Back in the old days when I was working as a Technical Architect (TA) at an agency that shall remain unnamed in this document, there were a number of incidents of ambitious sales people (or business development executives) selling technical solutions that were difficult or impossible to deliver. This difficulty arose because the solution was far beyond the budget of that client or because the underlying technology was so cutting edge that it was as yet unproven in the real world.

Inevitably this would lead to some frantic scrambling to define a deliverable solution without disappointing the client's expectations. This in turn would lead to a conflict where the TA was being pressed to find a way to build a utopic, robust, feature rich, production ready solution to a poorly defined problem on a shoestring budget.

Meetings as described above would often result in much swearing and name-calling, all of which can be summarised in the rather pithy **`FFS! TA!`**.

### The reality

I needed a name and thought this was funny at the time and my audience when creating the Slack was limited to people in that **`TA`** role.

Times changed, people moved on as they always do, but the name has stuck.


## But then ... why have `FFS-TA` at all?

The initial reason for creating the Slack was for me to keep in contact with people I had worked with, grown to respect, and felt I would miss if I were to sever ties completely. This was a way of maintaining contact with these good people.

I also had the vague notion that this might become something like a support group to me and to those in it. Whenever a conversation was going the way of the one described above, we could find comfort with old colleagues in this Slack. We could laugh over our coffee - or organic lapsang souchong - at the futility of such things and find comfort in the solidarity of others who have endured the same and somehow managed not to become unhinged.


## And why should you want to join?

I'm hoping that what you have heard is that - above all - this is a safe space to interact with (mostly) like-minded people.

More than that this is a safe space to share ideas without fear of ridicule of censure, to learn from others, to teach where appropriate, to offer help and support where you can, to ask for help and support where you need it and to find a connection with others when appropriate.

That should be enough.


## So what now?

Once you’re on board, the following suggestions and guidelines are intended to make your first days in the `FFS-TA` Slack more useful:

1. Go and introduce yourself on #intros. Tell us about yourself.
2. Update your profile with a photo. Add interesting and relevant facts in your profile. Make yourself a human.
3. There’s a Code of Conduct. **_[Read it!](./code.md)_**.
4. Explore the channels.
5. Please be careful with the use of broadcast features like @here or even @channel.
6. If your favourite topic isn’t being discussed, create it. **Channels are free.** Announce your newly created channel on #general.
7. All are welcome to contribute. If you want to hang back and lurk, that’s cool too.
8. We expect that we’ll treat others with respect. We encourage debate; we ask for patience, and we remind you that you’re here to share and learn and that means being open to a diverse set of ideas.
9. This Slack is **not** a place for commercial activity (e.g. recruiting, or marketing your product/conference) except in channels dedicated to that purpose and never in an unsolicited direct message. If you see commercial behaviour going down, alert the @justin, and he’ll address it.
10. If you know someone who should be here, drop @justin a direct message in the Slack, and he’ll invite them.
11. Really, read the **_[Code of Conduct](./code.md)_**.
