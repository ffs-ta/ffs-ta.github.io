All participants in the `FFS-TA` Slack are required to comply with the following Code of Conduct.

# The Short Version

- Be respectful of other people
- Respectfully ask people to stop if you are bothered
- Respect privacy

# The Long Version

### This Slack is intended to be a friendly environment where everyone should feel welcome, safe and comfortable to share ideas and engage in open discussion without threat of intimidation or public humiliation. We expect all participants to be respectful towards others at all times.

This policy is a living document and subject to refinement and updates in the future.

_Last updated on 31 July 2020._


This is a friendly community where everyone should feel welcome, safe and comfortable to share ideas and engage in open discussion. It’s really important for us to provide a harassment-free experience for everyone involved inclusive of gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, age, nationality or religion.

All participants are required to abide by this code of conduct at all times while online in the Slack and whenever meeting in person or at an event. Any violations will be dealt with as best we can and this may include being expelled from the Slack and banned from re-entry. While this might sound a toothless threat, since participation and membership is free, we will do our utmost to protect the safety of our community.

## Definitions
What do we mean by *_“harassment”_*? Harassment includes but isn’t limited to:

- Offensive comments related to [gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation](https://www.stonewall.org.uk/help-advice/glossary-terms), disability, mental illness, neurotype, physical appearance, body size, race, age, nationality, religion or belief, marital and civil partnership status, pregnancy or carer or parental status, familial status, veteran status, citizenship

- Deliberate “outing” of any aspect of a person’s identity without their consent
- Harassing photography or recording, including logging online activity for harassment purposes
- Sustained disruption of discussion

As far as it is possible for this group, we prioritise the safety of marginalised people over privileged people’s comfort. This means we reserve the right not to act on complaints regarding:

- Reverse-isms, including ‘reverse racism’, ‘reverse sexism’, and ‘cisphobia’
- Reasonable communication of boundaries, such as “leave me alone”, “go away”, “I’m not discussing this with you”
- Criticising racist, sexist, cissexist, or otherwise oppressive behaviour


## Consequences

Participants asked to stop any harassing behaviour are expected to stop immediately.

Participants engaging in harassing behaviour may be asked to leave the online space and may be banned temporarily or indefinitely.
